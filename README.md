```
/mex macroui off
```

Key Combinations|UI Frame|If Empty|Non Empty
:--|:--|:--|:--|
Shift + Left Click|Character Frame|/use SlotID|SlotID
Shift + Control + Left Click|Character Frame|/equip [condition]ItemName|/equip [condition]ItemName
Shift + Left Click|Bag Frame|/use ItemName|ItemName

#Conditional Statements
These can also be checked for falseness instead of trueness by prefixing them with **"no"**. For example, **[nocombat]** is a valid conditional and will only perform the actions following it if you are not in combat.

*Aliases are for creating a macro shorter if you run out of space*

### #show and #showtooltip
>They do not benefit from conditional behavior

####Syntax
```
#showtooltip spellname         <--Shows a spell icon
#showtooltip itemname          <--Shows an item by name
#showtooltip BagId slotNum     <--Shows an item by bag slot
#showtooltip InvSlot           <--Shows an item by inventory slot
```

####Examples
>The following macro will allow you to show the shard count and use the spell *Drain Soul* from one entire macro, If no *Soul Shard's* are present then it will show *Drain Soul* icon instead until a *Shoul Shard* is found in the player inventory

```
#show Soul Shard
/cast [nochanneling:drain soul]drain soul
```

##Parameter Usage
Multiple parameters can be included by separating them with a *slash* [**/**] check reference table to see which is supported

**condition**:*param1/param2/.../paramN*

Following example checks if any modifier key is down and not channeling the spell drain soul. If requirements are not met it will cast the next sequence in the list
```
/castsequence [mod,nochanneling:drain soul]drain soul;reset=target/combat corruption,curse of agony,shadow bolt,shadow bolt,shadow bolt,shadow bolt
```

To prevent the above example from continuing with the next sequence in the list which could interrupt your channeling spell, add the **[nochan]** which is the *alias for nochanneling*.
```
/castsequence [mod,nochanneling:drain soul]drain soul;[nochan]reset=target/combat corruption,curse of agony,shadow bolt,shadow bolt,shadow bolt,shadow bolt
```

***smartcast***
>Mana efficiency casting, will down rank the spell until it meets the required mana cost, if doesn't meet the requirement it will fail and try to cast without rank
*/pick, /use, /equip, /cast, /castrandom, /castsequence*

*Creation is class specific only*

name|useable by|create|description
:--|:--|:--|:--|
conjure water|all|create conjure water|Mage conjured water
conjure food|all|create conjure food|Mage conjured food
conjure mana|all|create conjure mana|Mage mana crystals such as *Mana Agate*/etc...
food|all|none|All non conjured items
bandage|all|none|Bandages
healthpotion|all|none|Healing potions
manapotion|all|none|Mana potions
healthstone|all|create healthstone|Warlock healthstone
firestone|Warlock|create firestone|Warlock firestone
spellstone|Warlock|create spellstone|Warlock spellstone
soulstone|Warlock|create soulstone|Warlock soulstone

####Usage
>If the players health is Lesser or Equal to 75% then *smartcast* will look up the player inventory and search for a *healthstone* of all ranks starting with the highest rank first.

```
/use [smartcast,target=player,health:<=75]healthstone
```

>Creating a *healthstone* if the player is a *warlock*

```
/cast [smartcast]create healthstone
```

***Buff / Debuff***
>Adding a prefix "**@**"  in the front of the *Buff/Debuff* will check the player instead of the target. This allows you too still direct harmful spells at the target

Following example checks for Nightfall Proc on the player if found will cast shadow bolt at target.
CastSequence will reset every 12 seconds / combat or target changes

####Correct way
```
/cast [buff:@Shadow_Twilight]shadow bolt
/castsequence [nochanneling,pet] reset=12/combat/target corruption,curse of agony,immolate
```

####Wrong way
This will not succeed as it will target the player to cast **shadow bolt**
```
/cast [target=player,buff:Shadow_Twilight]shadow bolt
```

***PBuff / PDebuff***
>This does not require the prefix "**@**" as this checks the player only.This was implemented so it didn't seem confusing for users

Will cast shadow bolt only if the warlock has gained Nightfall proc, otherwise cast immolate
```
/cast [pbuff:Shadow_Twilight]shadow bolt;Imolate
```

/eq [smartcast]firestone
```

>To create a warlock healthstone without repetitive editing of a macro each spell rank learned, use the smartcast option. Passing the spell without any rank information such as *minor/lesser/../major* If major is learned by the player then it will cast *Create Soulstone (Major)()* automatically for the player if the mana requirement is met, if not it will down rank until successful. This works with all ***Create [Spell's]/Conjure [Spell's]***,

```
/cast [smartcast]create healthstone
```

>To use the best healthstone found in the player inventory ordered as follows *major/greater/../lesser*

```
/use [smartcast]healthstone
```

>Create healthstone while a modifier key is down otherwise use the healthstone

```
/cast [mod,smartcast]create healthstone
/use [nomod,smartcast]healthstone
```

>Bellow is equivalent of the example above just shorter

```
/cast [mod,smartcast]create healthstone;[smartcast]healthstone
```

>Following macro allows you to create a spellstone if a modifier key is down, if no modifier key is down then equip it if not already equipped then use it

```
/cast [mod,smartcast]create spellstone;[nomod,smartcast,noequipped:17]spellstone;17
```

##Mage

>With 1.06.5 Changes, creating conjured items has changed. This allows the mage to create multiple stacks of water, before it would only create 1 stack then use the stack until it was gone, then repeat by recreating a new stack

######Creating Conjured Water

/cast [smartcast]create conjure water
```
######Using Conjured Water

/use [smartcast]conjure water
```

######Creating Mana Crystal

/cast [smartcast]create conjure mana
```

#Mount
>If left empty it will use the first mount found in the inventory

```
/mount
```

###Randomly
>Will randomly select a mount in the players inventory

```
/mount random
```

###Search
>Will search the player inventory and will mount the character with very the first results found **red skele**. The ordered of search is determined by location of the bag and inventory slot

**If the player inventory contains the following mounts**

* Green Skeletal Horse
* Blue Skeletal Horse
* Red Qiraji Resonating Crystal
* Red Skeletal Warhorse
* Red Skeletal horse

The search will go from *Top* to *Bottom* until the search criteria is met. The result would be **Red Skeletal Warhorse** as long the player is not in combat
```
/mount [nocombat]red skele
```

#####Wildcard Search
>Wildcard searching for **Red Skeletal Warhorse**. It will search all of the player collected mounts until the first pattern in the search criteria found

```

```
